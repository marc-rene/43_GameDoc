This is the same novel that the popular FPS franchise S.T.A.L.K.E.R, and the film of the same name, are based on. The story will continue with the STALKER version of the story, with the dissolution of the USSR due to a second nuclear disaster in Chornobyl in 2006 and the creation of “The Zone”, but will be set in a diverging universe from the game. </p></section><section data-v-d61922bc><h2 data-v-d61922bc> What is the Story? </h2><hr data-v-d61922bc><p data-v-d61922bc> The Story of Forty-Three starts several years after the events of the STALKER franchise, in 2020. In the story of STALKER, a group of scientists experimented with mass mind alteration, helping to lead to the second meltdown. In the STALKER franchise, these scientists were killed by the player, but in Forty-Three, the player joined them. The player starts out in a facility as a simple cleaner, but after a disastrous enemy raid, the player is separated from everyone and must survive and escape the zone any way they can. Having been labelled a deserter, the player is on their own to make new allies to help them leave the zone. After finally escaping, the player is called back to the facility through their dreams and dwindling health. Something powerful is buried there and must either be freed or destroyed. The identity of this being/object must be kept mysterious. </p></section><section data-v-d61922bc><h2 data-v-d61922bc> What is the Atmosphere and feeling? </h2><hr data-v-d61922bc><p data-v-d61922bc> The world of Forty-Three is bleak, hardcore, yet also hopeful at times. Life outside of the zone has prospered due to the zone and its many. The zone is a bleak place, the feeling of decay, radiation, and danger is around every corner. Between bandits, armies, STALKERs, wildlife, mutants, reality-breaking artifacts, and pockets of immense radiation, the zone is as dangerous, as it is alluring and freeing. Camps and friendly outposts offer a warm and safe space, in stark contrast to the cold and dangerous zone. The player starts off in a research facility in the zone as a cleaner. Safe from the outside, the atmosphere and feeling should reflect this. After the enemy raid, the player is flung into the zone at night. The bleak and dangerous atmosphere of the zone will be present. Changing of scenes and locations will help differentiate each scene from each other. Each level should be different from the previous one to help give a feeling of progression. The aim is to have a comic book art style. Cutscenes will ideally be excerpts from a comic book, saving on animation time, as cutscenes will be screenshots and edited in Adobe illustrator for special effects. </p></section></div>',2),O=[E];function P(e,t,a,r,i,o){return(0,n.wg)(),(0,n.iD)("div",A,O)}var j={name:"PreProd",props:{}};const I=(0,p.Z)(j,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-d61922bc"]]);var R=I,z={name:"App",components:{HomeIntro:m,WhereTo:S,PreProd:R}};const C=(0,p.Z)(z,[["render",i]]);var L=C;(0,r.ri)(L).mount("#app")}},t={};function a(r){var n=t[r];if(void 0!==n)return n.exports;var i=t[r]={exports:{}};return e[r].call(i.exports,i,i.exports,a),i.exports}a.m=e,function(){var e=[];a.O=function(t,r,n,i){if(!r){var o=1/0;for(h=0;h<e.length;h++){r=e[h][0],n=e[h][1],i=e[h][2];for(var s=!0,d=0;d<r.length;d++)(!1&i||o>=i)&&Object.keys(a.O).every((function(e){return a.O[e](r[d])}))?r.splice(d--,1):(s=!1,i<o&&(o=i));if(s){e.splice(h--,1);var c=n();void 0!==c&&(t=c)}}return t}i=i||0;for(var h=e.length;h>0&&e[h-1][2]>i;h--)e[h]=e[h-1];e[h]=[r,n,i]}}(),function(){a.n=function(e){var t=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e["default"]}:function(){return e};return a.d(t,{a:t}),t}}(),function(){a.d=function(e,t){for(var r in t)a.o(t,r)&&!a.o(e,r)&&Object.defineProperty(e,r,{enumerable:!0,get:t[r]})}}(),function(){a.g=function(){if("object"===typeof globalThis)return globalThis;try{return this||new Function("return this")()}catch(e){if("object"===typeof window)return window}}()}(),function(){a.o=function(e,t){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,t)}}(),function(){a.p=""}(),function(){var e={143:0};a.O.j=function(t){return 0===e[t]};var t=function(t,r){var n,i,o=r[0],s=r[1],d=r[2],c=0;if(o.some((function(t){return 0!==e[t]}))){for(n in s)a.o(s,n)&&(a.m[n]=s[n]);if(d)var h=d(a)}for(t&&t(r);c<o.length;c++)i=o[c],a.o(e,i)&&e[i]&&e[i][0](),e[i]=0;return a.O(h)},r=self["webpackChunkforty_three"]=self["webpackChunkforty_three"]||[];r.forEach(t.bind(null,0)),r.push=t.bind(null,r.push.bind(r))}();var r=a.O(void 0,[998],(function(){return a(2716)}));r=a.O(r)})();
